  An introduction
</h2>
<p>Abs0rb.me is an online multiplayer game, much like Agar.io, where players control cells aiming to grow by absorbing
  others. The game is built around it's in-game economy of items, featuring a reward system, marketplace, and trading.
  It helps encourage making connections with other users with its built-in friend system, chat, and clans system.</p>

  Authentication built in-house
</h2>
<p>The core of the project is built on a user authentication flow that I've developed myself and iterated on since 2015.
  It's the backbone of the website, handling every request coming in. Below is a simplified flow diagram of how user
  authentication is handled.</p>

<p class="dark:mt-4">The system has gone through countless iterations while retaining user data with improvements to security and
  performance.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3 mt-10 manrope">
  User experience and design
</h2>
<p>The website was designed from the ground up with Bootstrap and good ol' CSS. The website is also <b>fully
  responsive</b>, compatible with mobile devices and tablets.</p>

  Running on bare metal
</h2>
<p>We manage our own servers in Quebec to host the website. I've even made custom release and deployment scripts in
  GitHub actions to help automate our flows.</p>

  Whew, that's a lot
</h2>
<p>There is so much I want to write about, this project is <b>very</b> extensive. It's taken me (and two others, thanks
  Luka and Seth ðŸ˜‰) to build this website. It's been constantly iterated over the years to get to where we are with lots
  to learn.</p>
