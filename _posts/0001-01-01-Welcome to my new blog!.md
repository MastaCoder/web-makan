### Welcome to my first blog post.
I am **testing** my *first* ever ~~forum~~ blog post. This was made using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a pretty
powerful library to create __s t a t i c__ websites.

You might be wondering, why am I writing like this? Well, because this post was written in markdown. Of course I am the
god of markdown, so clearly I know a few things pfft.

Now I wonder if images work?

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/blog-img/thumbs-up.jpg" alt="kid thumbs up" style="max-width: 550px;" />

And... this is just some text that comes after an image. Usually would see a header.

### Something like this
You see?

#### Or this
That's just a smaller header lol

### You ever see a list?
I wonder if lists work
- Test
- More test?
- **MORE** TEST

I think it works? INCREDIBLE. This is a very neat blog post. Until next time.
