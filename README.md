This is the source code for my personal website built with 11ty.

## Features

Currently, it just consists of a homepage. Will be building more as time goes on.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run serve
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) with your browser to see the result.

## Building

To build you just need to run

```
npm run build
```

Then host the `dist` folder on any static site hosting platform.
