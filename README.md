Welcome to the repo for my portfolio! Written in plain HTML/CSS/JS alongside Jekyll!

### Don't copy the libraries!
The MDBootstrap version on the website is licensed and hosted on a seperate server. Use of the library can get your 
website taken down since you won't have a valid license to use it. Feel free to grab a few copy from the "Get Started" 
guide at [/mdbootstrap.com/](https://mdbootstrap.com) or purchase your own copy.
